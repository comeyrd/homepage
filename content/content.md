# Projects : 
Most of the things i do for fun are public on my github, here is a non exaustive list of one of my favorite projects

## textcompressor
[repo link](https://github.com/comeyrd/textcompressor)

A simple c++ text compression program.

## AccessControl
[repo link](https://github.com/comeyrd/Accesscontrol)

Javascript modules to manage authentification, users, their informations and administration.
Basically a wrapper over SQL to do simple tasks.

## Mportal
[repo link](https://github.com/comeyrd/MitiAuth-Portal)

A website using the AccessControl modules.
The goal is to have a base website with authentication, basic administration and access control depending on the type of users.
When finished, could be used as base to create any project.

To test the project :

With the logins : 
- user:user
- admin:admin

## Fupload
[repo link](https://github.com/comeyrd/web-simplefile)

The bare base for a single file per user sharing website, waiting for the 'end' of Mportal to fork it and finish this one

## Api's

Not a github repo yet, but working on a express boiler plate to create REST api's over SQL easily.

## Other random projects : 

A simple QR code maker for personal use :
