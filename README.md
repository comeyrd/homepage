# Homepage

This repository is where the code of my personal website ([https://ceyraud.com](https://ceyraud.com)) is located.
This is a custom site build with ejs and a custom HTML page.
It loads from markdowns in the content directory. 
There is a projects.json that repertories which project i want to display on my Blog.
The page is then generated based on the Readme's and About's of the projects.
